Sue tried to help the flower. She gave it water and put it near the window. But the flower did not get enough sun. It tried very hard to bloom, but it could not. The flower became sad and said, "I am sorry, Sue. I cannot be a fancy flower in your room."

Lucy listened carefully, but the words were all strange to her. She then noticed one wealthy man pointing to his toes. She wondered why and asked her dad, "What's he pointing at?"

Her dad laughed and smiled, "That man is showing off his money! He's wealthy and he wants everyone to know."

This made little Lucy excited. She wished she had money too. She wanted to show off her wealth like the man.

But then her dad said something that made her sad. He said, "It's just playing pretend. You don't need money to have fun!"

So Lucy put away her dreams of being wealthy and went back to playing with her toys. But secretly she still hoped one day she could show off her own wealth too!

Once there was a boy who liked to run. Every day he ran faster and faster. He was so fast that he seemed to float rather than run! One day, his mommy gave him a weight to carry. It was big and heavy, but the boy didnâ€™t mind. He held on tightly and ran with it, as if it were nothing.

He ran for hours and hours, never stopping for a rest. The weight grew heavier and heavier, but the boy never thought about it. He kept on running, ever faster and ever further.

Then, all of a sudden, the boy felt himself trip! He had been so careless, he couldnâ€™t keep his footing. He had been running too fast and too far, with too much weight in his hands. The weight had been too heavy for him, and as he fell, he knew that he had gone much too far. Now it was time to turn around and run back home.

Once upon a time there was a coat frame. It was fit for a special occasion. A little girl named Rachel came to try it on.

"It looks beautiful," said her mother. Rachel smiled in delight.

The frame was no longer disturbed. It was standing up straight and Rachel looked wonderful. That's how Rachel got to wear the perfect coat frame for her special day!

One day, Lizzie spotted a rabbit hopping along the country road. She looked at her car and said, â€œOh dear! We need to speed up or weâ€™ll never catch this rabbit!â€ So, Lizzie put her foot down on the pedal and the car began to go faster.

The rabbit kept hopping along, faster and faster, until it was a tiny blur on the horizon. But the car managed to keep up, going at a modest speed. In the end, Lizzie drove her car all the way to the end of the country road and the rabbit hopped off into the sunset.

One day, Mary was sitting on the grass in the park, eating a sandwich. She chewed it slowly, looking around. Suddenly, something sparkly caught her eye - it was a silver necklace glistening in the sun. Mary noticed it was near a bush, so she crawled over to take a closer look. 

When she got close, Mary could see that the necklace was suspended from a thin branch. She reached out to take it in her tiny hand and felt it's cool metal. 

Just then, a voice called out from behind her. It was an old woman. 
 
"Do you like it?" she said.

Mary was a bit anxious but nodded and smiled.

"It's yours," the woman said warmly. "I saw you admiring it and thought you might like to have it."

Mary thanked the woman politely, before heading home with the new silver necklace in her pocket. From that day onward, every time Mary chewed her lunch in the park, she would also play with her silver necklace, and think back to the day when she had first seen it.

Suddenly, her friend Mary came over and asked if she wanted to play. Lucy said yes but Mary thought of something else to do. She wanted to cut her chalk in half. 

Lucy was not happy about this. She didn't want anyone to mess with her original chalk. But, Mary kept insisting and said, "C'mon Lucy, let's cut the chalk! It'll be fun!"

Lucy refused but with some convincing from Mary, she agreed to it. So, they got a knife and started cutting the chalk. But, to their surprise, the chalk pieces became smaller and smaller until the chalk disappeared.

Lucy felt sad. She knew that her chalk could never be the same again. Better not to mess with an original.

Amy said, â€œCan you paint my bedroom? It would look so much better.â€

The painter smiled again and said, â€œYes, I can do that for you. I can make it very special.â€

Lola gasped in surprise and said, "I did it!" She grabbed one of the pastry pieces and took a big bite. It tasted so sweet and delicious. 

Suddenly, Lola heard her mother's voice and she knew it was time to go home. She quickly picked up the other piece of pastry and ran to her mother. 

Lola showed her mom the pastry and said, "Look what I found!" Her mother smiled and said, "It sure looks yummy. Now let's put it in a bag until we get home."

Max was so happy he began to settle in. He was grateful for his friends' help. He felt safer in his nest and didn't feel so helpless anymore.

One day Max had an idea. He asked his friends, "What if I set up a will? That way, if something happens to me, you can take care of my nest."

Max's friends thought this was a great idea. So Max wrote a will that his friends would follow after he was gone. He was so relieved to have this plan in place. 

Max's friends made sure to take care of him and the nest. With their help, Max was able to settle in to his new home peacefully.

Once upon a time, there was a light beetle. He had never been outside and wanted to see the world.

So one day, the beetle crawled out of its box and looked around. Suddenly, he saw a big tree and decided to climb it. He worked up the trunk and made it to the top, but found he was stuck.

"Help!" the beetle cried.

Just then, a bird flew by and heard the beetle's cry.

"What's wrong little beetle?" asked the bird.

The beetle explained what had happened, and the bird laughed.

"My friend, the ant, can help you," said the bird. "Let me take you to her."

The bird took the beetle to the ant, who said she could help. She pulled and tugged, and the beetle worked his way around the branch, until he was finally free.

"What are you trying to do, Jack?" asked his mother, who had just seen him.

"I am trying to print the pill, mum," answered Jack. 

"Oh, the pill is too small to print. Let's find something else that is bigger and easier to print," said his mother.

So, Jack and his mother went outside and found a big red leaf which they printed. Jack was very happy! The printed leaf was very colourful and beautiful. From then on, Jack kept printing lots of colourful things.

Mummy was getting angry now. She told Timmy, "If you don't give me the hanger, you won't get any ice cream." Timmy still refused and said he wanted to pick it himself. He stomped his feet on the floor.

Once upon a time, there lived an orange tree. All the oranges on the tree were delicious and juicy. The tree wanted to share its delicious oranges with the world. One day, it decided to give away all of its oranges to the local animals.

The animal friends were delighted! The squirrels, birds, rabbits, and more all shared the oranges. They each had as much as they wanted to eat. But the tree remained sad, for it no longer had any oranges left to share.

Just then, the sun began to shine brighter and the sunâ€™s warmth brought new life to the tree. Its branches were soon filled with many delicious oranges. 

This time, the tree decided to be more careful. It only gave away five oranges each day and kept the rest. This made it happy and it could remain generous without becoming empty.

The moral of this story is that if we are generous, we can remain happy and still have a lot to give.

"I want to join!" the little girl shouted happily.

One of the adults in the parade saw the little girl and gave her a big smile. "Come on" he said, diving into the parade, "Come join the fun!"

The little girl followed him and started to dance with the other children. Everyone was laughing and having a great time.

But soon the little girl became frustrated. She couldn't keep up with the other children, and they were all having more fun than her. But then one of the adults came over and said:

"Come on, let's show them how to dive in this parade."

With a big smile, the little girl followed the adult and started to dance and sing. Soon, she was singing and dancing just like the other children, and everyone was having a great time. The little girl was happy and no longer frustrated.

He ventured in. Soon enough, he came across an extraordinary sight. A giant tree that had a swing that went way up high, so high he could touch the sky. He was so excited he just had to give it a try. So he climbed up the tree and squeezed himself onto the swing seat. 

He started swinging and swaying and before long he was feeling so merry and carefree. Suddenly, he felt a massive hand squeeze him tight. He looked around and saw an old and miserable giant. The giant spoke in a grumbling voice, "You don't belong in my forest, get away!" 

The little boy was scared and quickly jumped down from the swing. He was so sad, he had to leave the wonderful adventure he had been having. He quietly went home, feeling more than a little miserable.

Suddenly, they spotted a pile of match boxes near the harbor. Jack and Jill were so excited, they grabbed one of the match boxes and began to match the colorful boxes. They played at the harbor all day, matching the pretty match boxes until the sun started to go down.

Jack ignored her and he went nearer and nearer. Jill got worried and she said, "Jack stop! I'm scared!"

Jack didn't listen and he was about to jump in. Jill got very scared, so she shouted, "No Jack! Panic!"

Jack was so sorry, he jumped back and started crying. Jill hugged him tight and said, "It's ok, Jack. Don't worry. I'm sorry I scared you." 

Jack smiled and they hugged each other. They never came near the well again. 

The end.

Once upon a time there was a white phone. The phone was special and could fold out. One day, a little girl, who was three years old, saw the phone and said "Wow!" 

The girl wanted to play with the phone, so she carefully folded out the phone. She thought the phone looked like a butterfly. She was very excited and started to giggle.

The girl's mother saw her playing with the phone and said, "No, you must be gentle with it. Folding the phone out is a special thing you can only do when you get older." 

The little girl understood and started to fold the phone back together. When she finished folding it, she said "Wow!" again. Then she put the phone carefully back on the table. 

The end.

Once there was a strong stone. It wanted to stay by itself so it could be alone. But that was hard to do in the forest. Every day an animal would come by and try to move the stone. But the stone was strong and wouldn't budge.

Then one day, a butterfly flew by and asked the stone why it wanted to stay by itself. The butterfly said it would like to be friends with the stone. The stone was very happy.

The butterfly and the stone became great friends. Every day, the butterfly would come to visit and stay with the stone. The stone was so glad that it didn't have to be alone any more. It was strong and would stay with its friend forever.

Mummy was with her little girl in the park. The little girl loved to play on the swings and they had been there a long time. 
Mummy said, "We should go soon. It's getting dark."
But the little girl protested, "No, I want to stay here!" She was having so much fun. 
Mummy sighed. She urged the little girl to leave, but the little girl's feelings were too strong.

Mummy was starting to worry. She was worried about the darkness, and that the little girl might get tired and weak. She said, "Come on sweetheart, we must go now."
The little girl felt a bit weak, so finally she agreed to go. Mummy was happy, because she was no longer worried.

A mummy and her little girl called Sarah were getting ready to go on a trip. Sarah watched as her mummy packed a big sack with lots of things.

"What's in that sack, Mummy?" asked Sarah.

Mummy replied, "It's full of lots of fun things that we can take with us on our trip."

Sarah asked, "Can I take my dolly?"

Mummy replied, "Yes of course, but you will have to pack it into the sack yourself."

Sarah was excited and put her dolly safely into the big sack. She looked up at her mummy and smiled.

On the trip, Sarah met lots of friendly people and things she had not seen before. She was having a wonderful time. 

When it was time to go home, Sarah remembered that she had put her dolly in the sack and so she checked to make sure it was still there. It was! 

Mummy said to her, "Isn't it nice when things are packed up neatly and safely?"

Sarah nodded and smiled.

The moral of the story is to be careful to always pack up things neatly and safely, which helps us to take care of our possessions.

But mom said no, it was too little and she was too old. 
Molly was so sad and asked, "Why can't I sleep in my crib? It's so cozy and fun!"

Mom said, "It's too small, Molly. You're getting so big that you need a big bed now. Come on, I'll have a fun time picking out a big bed with you!" 

Molly smiled. She wasn't sure why her crib couldn't be her bed anymore, but it was funny to think of sleeping in a big bed!

Once there was a bear who loved spicy food. He always used to pick the spiciest of all the food in the village. One day, he was making his usual rounds at the village market when he saw his friend, the rabbit. The bear waved and the rabbit bowed in response.

The bear asked the rabbit what he had in his basket and the rabbit replied, "I'm bringing yummy carrot cake to my grandmother. It's her favourite."

The bear immediately started drooling. He asked the rabbit if he could have some and the rabbit said, "Sure, but it's really spicy. Are you sure you can take such a pain?"

The bear was too excited to wait. He eagerly took the carrot cake and bit into it. Alas! The bear had never tasted such a spicy food before. Suddenly his mouth was on fire and he yelped in pain.

The bear learnt a lesson that day: when it comes to food, not everything that tastes fancy is necessarily best for you.

Once upon a time, there was a brave turtle. She was very small, but full of courage. One day, she decided to explore the big world and find new things.

The turtle smiled and started to play with the stones and crystals. She forgot about the time, until it got dark and she decided to crawl back home.

The turtle was very happy. She found an amazing place she never knew existed before. Whenever she felt sad, she remembered that magical place she'd seen and smiled.

Once upon a time there was a fat penny. She looked so shiny and beautiful that she made a young boy smile. The boy picked up the penny and decided to take it home with him.

When he arrived home, the boy's mother said, "You can't keep the penny, it doesn't belong to us. You have to return it."

The boy wasn't too happy about that but he had no choice. He slowly walked back to the place where he had found the penny and put it back on the ground. 

Suddenly, a fat rat jumped out of nowhere and snatched the penny away. The boy was so surprised that he forgot to chase after the rat.

The boy never saw his penny again. He was very sad.

The boy was surprisedâ€” he thought it was unusual but very cool! He asked the lady to teach him sign language and she gladly agreed!

From then on, the little boy and the lady shared a special bondâ€” they both knew that being different could be a wonderful thing.

John was walking outside on a warm summer day. He was laughing and feeling happy. Suddenly, he saw a small pile of ash on the ground. He smiled and decided to explore what it was. He bent down and opened the pile of ash. Inside, he saw a little bird. It was still alive, but barely. John smiled and ran to find help for the bird. 

He called to a man walking by and asked for help. The man said "No, I don't care. Leave it alone and get away from it." John said "Please help the bird. It needs my help."
